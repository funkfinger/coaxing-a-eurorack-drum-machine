# PCM5102A Troubleshooting Guide

## ‚úÖ **Confirmed Working:**
- Pico GPIO pins are toggling correctly (3.3V ‚Üî 0V)
- Breadboard connections are receiving signals
- PlatformIO upload and serial communication working

## üîç **PCM5102A Specific Checks**

### 1. **Power Supply Verification**
**Check with multimeter:**
- VCC to GND should read **3.3V** (¬±0.1V)
- If no voltage: Check 3.3V connection from Pico Pin 36
- If wrong voltage: Check for loose connections

### 2. **PCM5102A Board Configuration**
Most PCM5102A boards have **solder jumpers** that MUST be set correctly:

**Required Settings:**
- **H1**: Must be **SHORTED** (enables 3.3V operation)
- **H2**: Must be **SHORTED** (enables internal PLL)
- **H3**: Must be **SHORTED** (I2S format)

**How to check:**
- Look for tiny solder pads labeled H1, H2, H3 on the PCM5102A board
- They should have solder bridges connecting the pads
- If open, add solder to bridge the connections

### 3. **Pin Connection Verification**
**Double-check these exact connections:**
```
Pico Pin 36 (3V3)    ‚Üí PCM5102A VCC
Pico Pin 38 (GND)    ‚Üí PCM5102A GND
Pico GPIO 18 (Pin 24) ‚Üí PCM5102A BCK
Pico GPIO 19 (Pin 25) ‚Üí PCM5102A DIN
Pico GPIO 20 (Pin 26) ‚Üí PCM5102A LCK
```

**Common mistakes:**
- Wrong pin numbers (use GPIO numbers, not physical pin numbers)
- Loose breadboard connections
- Wrong PCM5102A pin labels (some boards vary)

### 4. **PCM5102A Board Variants**
Different suppliers use different pin layouts:

**Type A (Most Common):**
```
VCC  GND  BCK  DIN  LCK  LOUT  ROUT  AGND
```

**Type B:**
```
VIN  GND  BCK  DIN  LCK  LOUT  ROUT  GND
```

**Type C:**
```
VCC  3V3  GND  BCK  DIN  LCK  LOUT  ROUT  AGND
```

Make sure you're connecting to the right pins for YOUR specific board!

### 5. **Audio Output Testing**
**Test different connection methods:**

**Method 1 - Stereo Headphones:**
- Left wire ‚Üí LOUT
- Right wire ‚Üí ROUT
- Ground wire ‚Üí AGND (or GND)

**Method 2 - Mono Test:**
- One headphone wire ‚Üí LOUT
- Other headphone wire ‚Üí AGND

**Method 3 - Speaker Test:**
- Small speaker (+) ‚Üí LOUT
- Small speaker (-) ‚Üí AGND

### 6. **Signal Verification with Multimeter**
**While GPIO test is running:**
- BCK pin: Should show ~1.65V average (toggling between 0V and 3.3V)
- DIN pin: Should show ~1.65V average
- LCK pin: Should show ~1.65V average

**If pins show 0V or 3.3V steady:** Connection problem
**If pins show ~1.65V:** Signals are reaching PCM5102A ‚úÖ

### 7. **PCM5102A Board Quality Issues**
**Some cheap boards have problems:**
- Faulty solder joints
- Wrong component values
- Missing components
- Incorrect PCB layout

**Test with known good board if available**

### 8. **Alternative PCM5102A Boards to Try**
If current board doesn't work:
- Adafruit I2S 3W Class D Amplifier Breakout - MAX98357A
- SparkFun Audio DAC Breakout - CS4344
- Different PCM5102A supplier

## üîß **Next Steps**

### Step 1: Check Power
Use multimeter to verify 3.3V between VCC and GND on PCM5102A

### Step 2: Check Jumpers
Verify H1, H2, H3 are shorted with solder bridges

### Step 3: Check Pin Layout
Confirm you're using the right pins for your specific PCM5102A board

### Step 4: Test Audio Output
Try different headphones/speakers and connection methods

### Step 5: Signal Verification
Use multimeter to check signals are reaching PCM5102A pins

## üì∏ **What to Check Next**
1. Take a photo of your PCM5102A board (both sides)
2. Check the part number/markings on the board
3. Verify the jumper settings with a magnifying glass
4. Test with different headphones/speakers

## üéØ **Most Likely Issues**
1. **Jumpers not set** (H1, H2, H3 need solder bridges)
2. **Wrong pin connections** (check your specific board layout)
3. **Power supply issue** (not getting 3.3V)
4. **Faulty PCM5102A board** (try different board)

The GPIO test proves your Pico and code are working correctly - the issue is definitely with the PCM5102A setup!
